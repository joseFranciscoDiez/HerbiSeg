## HerbiSeg: Semantic Segmentation for Large Herbivore Grazing Trails Detection

Identifying spatial regions where biodiversity is threatened is crucial for effective ecosystem conservation and monitoring. In this study, we assessed varios machine learning methods to detect grazing trails automatically. We tested five semantic segmentation models combined with 14 different encoder networks. The best combination was UNet with MambaOut encoder. The solution proposed could be used as the basis for tools aiming at mapping and tracking changes in grazing trails on a continuous temporal basis.
